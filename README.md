## WebServices explaination

TTC tracks the following data:

- Minecraft name
- Last time the client was started
- Last time the client was closed
- Playtime with the client installed
- Analytics about versions:
  - Version number
  - Client name (in case of fork)
  - Github repo (in case of fork)

TTC does not track:

- Your minecraft login data (some say the password 
key in the api is a Minecraft password, but in reality, it is
only even a thing in premium accounts, and is used to store a 
double-hash of the selected password for logging into TTC premium)
- Your minecraft session
- Your IP (the ip key in user records is still showing REDACTED so
very old ones don't get leaked, now, it will always be 127.0.0.1 due
to the DDOS protection. it was originally used for IP banning, however,
there were incidents where IPs were leaked)
- Your windows username (unlike future, impact, pyro, and many others)
- Your GPS (unlike impact)
